# seminar-one-project

Here I will be creating a backend and frontend for a pet project "Seminar One". This is a complete package for someone conducting seminars on any sort of products ranging from agriculture to technology. Also, 
I am planning to incorporate my learnings from data science field to do data analysis on the generated data by this software. All the data that are generated will be dummy data.
